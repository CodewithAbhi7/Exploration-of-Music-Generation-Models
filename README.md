# Exploration of Music Generation Models

This project explores various music generation models, including autoregressive, CNN, GAN, GRU, LSTM, RNN, Seq2Seq, Transformer, and VAE-based approaches. Each model is implemented and tested in Python to evaluate its effectiveness in generating music sequences.

## Project Overview

Music generation models are designed to generate coherent musical sequences, simulating patterns learned from a dataset of music. This project implements several different types of models, each with its unique architecture and approach to generating music. The models range from simpler RNNs to more complex GAN and Transformer-based architectures. Each model is saved as a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and modification.
